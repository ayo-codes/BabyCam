# Project Name BabyCam 
#### Student Name: Ayodele Onamusi   Student ID: 20099854



I would like to make a baby camera device with my raspberry pi. The raspberry pi will be able to stream video , audio and send environmental readings to an app or a website via the internet. This will enable a parent to see/hear what is happening with their child.

If there is time , I would like to further extend the functionality to where the user would be able to act on information sent to them by relaying an action on to another app e.g alexa.

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

For this project, I will need 
- an Rpi
- a canakit camera
